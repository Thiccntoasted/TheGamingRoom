# TheGamingRoom



The Gaming Room, our client, wanted us to design a game software called "Draw It or Lose It." It was originally exclusive to Android but they wanted it to be multi-platform, including web-based ones. The game involves teams that compete to identify a random image within a set time limit.

My thorough identification and detailing of client's business and technical requirements were notably strong. This precision helped us identify specific design constraints and develop a comprehensive solution that addressed all client needs.

Developing a design document was immensely helpful in structuring our coding process. It allowed us to layout the system architecture, domain model, and evaluation strategies, making sure we cover all bases before proceeding with the code.

The evaluation section could use a bit more refinement. To improve it, I would include more explicit and comparative evaluations of different operating platforms. This would provide a more robust foundation for making an informed decision on the best platform for the software.

User's needs were interpreted through the provided software requirements and their desires to expand the platform scope. It's essential to consider these needs to ensure the final software product is user-friendly, effective, and meets the expectations.

I used an iterative approach in software design. Starting from understanding client requirements, analyzing system architecture, to making evaluations and recommendations. In the future, I would use techniques like user interviews, prototyping, and continuous testing to enhance the software design process further. These methods are excellent for improving usability, performance, and ensuring the application's success.
